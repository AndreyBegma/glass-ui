/**
 * FEAT-20260831-501 — the one rule that has to survive a second application.
 *
 * In Luna Watch this lived in `CLAUDE.md` as prose, which works exactly as long
 * as everyone writing components has read it. A package is used by people and
 * agents who have not, so the rule arrives with the code as a build failure.
 *
 * Colour is spelled in exactly one file — `tokens.css` — and everything else
 * refers to it by name. That is what buys the palette being changeable: a
 * redesign is an edit to one file rather than a search across two repositories.
 *
 * Deliberately not scanning the CSS. `tokens.css` is where hex is *supposed* to
 * be, and `material.css` builds the material out of `rgb()` by necessity. The
 * ban is on a component reaching for a colour instead of a token.

 * `black` and `white` at an opacity are the one thing left that is a colour
 * rather than a token, and every survivor is listed here with the reason.
 *
 * They are not an oversight and they are not free to grow: a scrim is black by
 * definition — it is a film over whatever is behind it, not a surface with a
 * hue — and the design system has no token that means "a film over the page".
 * The slider track and the sheet's grab handle are the same argument at the
 * other end: they are the material's own highlight, not ink.
 *
 * FEAT-20260831-501 moved these verbatim and deliberately did not re-decide
 * them; a move that also edits is a move nobody can review. Giving them names
 * is worth doing and is its own change. Until then, this list is the ceiling:
 * a new one fails the build.
